\section{Introduction to elliptic curves}

Formally, an elliptic curve is any implicit function where one variable has a degree of 2 and the other has a degree of 3. The kind we are interested in is elliptic curves in \textbf{short Weierstrass form}. This means they are in the form $y^2 = x^3 + ax^2 + b$. Examples of elliptic curves in short Weierstrass form can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:curves}.

\subsection{Elliptic curves as an abelian variety}

An abelian group \textit{under a certain operation} is a group for which that operation is closed, commutative and associative, and for which there exists an inverse for every element and an identity element.\cite[11]{wp}

A group $G$ that acts as an abelian group under an operation addition, $+$, is written as $(G, +)$. In other words, an abelian group $(G, +)$ has the following properties for all elements $A \in G$:\cite[11]{guide}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Commutativity.} $A + B = B + A$.
    \item \textbf{Associativity.} $(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)$.
    \item \textbf{Identity element.} There exists an element $I$ such that $A + I = I + A = A$.
    \item \textbf{Inverse elements.} $A + A' = A' + A = I$, where $A'$ is the inverse of $A$.
\end{enumerate}

An example of an abelian group is the integers under addition $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, with the identity element $0$. The inverse of, for example, $3$ is $-3$. An example of something that is \textit{not} an abelian group is the real numbers under multiplication $(\mathbb{R}, \times)$, because $0$ has no inverse. However, the real numbers excluding $0$ is an abelian group $(\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}, \times)$.

\subsection{Point addition \& doubling}

\subsubsection{Proof}

Take two points on an elliptic curve $E$ where $A(x_1, y_1) + B(x_2, y_2) = C(x_3, y_3)$ . Let the line through $A$, $B$ and $C'(x_3, -y_3)$ be $L$ such that
\begin{gather*}
    E: y^2 = x^2 + ax + b \\
    L: y = \lambda x + m \\
    \text{where } \lambda = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
\end{gather*}

The intersection of $E$ and $L$ satisfies the equation
\begin{align*}
    x^3 + ax + b = (\lambda x + m)^2 \\
    x^3 + ax + b = \lambda^2 x^2 + 2 \lambda x m + m^2 \\
    x^3 - \lambda^2 x^2 + (a - 2 \lambda m)x + b - m^2
\end{align*}

We also know this equation has roots at $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$, and can be written as
\begin{align*}
    (x-x_1)(x-x_2)(x-x_3)=0 \\
    x^3 - (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)x^2 + (x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 + x_2x_3)x - x_1x_2x_3 = 0
\end{align*}

Comparing coefficients of $x^2$ in the two forms of the equation, we can see that \[\lambda^2 = x_1 + x_2 = x_3\] and therefore \[x_3 = \lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2\]

Which gives the equation for $x_3$. To find $y_3$, we use the fact that $\lambda$ is also equal to the gradient between $C'(x_3, -y_3)$ and $B$:
\begin{align*}
    \lambda = \frac{-y_3-y_1}{x_3-x_1} \\
    -y_3 - y_1 = \lambda(x_3-x_1) \\
    y_3 = \lambda(x_1-x_3)-y_1
\end{align*}
and we have the equation for $y_3$.\cite{proof}

Adapting these equations for point doubling $A + A = C$ is easy; as the line is no longer through two points but rather the tangent at $A$, we differentiate $E$ to find the new gradient $\lambda$:
\begin{align*}
    y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \\
    2y\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + a \\
    \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x^2 + a}{2y}
\end{align*}
and so \[\lambda = \frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1}\]

Also, as $x_1 = x_2$, the equation for $x_3$ becomes \[x_3 = \lambda^2-2x_1\]

The equation for $y_3$ is unchanged.

\subsection{Point at infinity}

When the points of an elliptic curve are used as an abelian group $(G, +)$, we define an identity element, the \textit{point at infinity}, which is written as $\infty$, $\mathcal{O}$ or $0$. This is a point on the curve such that, for any point $A$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $A + \infty = A$
    \item $\infty + A = A$
    \item $A + A' = \infty$ where $A'$ is the inverse of $A$
    \item $\infty + \infty = \infty$
\end{enumerate}
