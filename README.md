# Edu-ECC [WIP]

A simplified visual demonstration of several mathematical concepts in cryptography. Currently a work in progress. Part of my Independent Research Project. <!-- 1x -->


## Structure

This project is composed of two parts:
- [A program](#program-edu-ecc) written in Python used to visually demonstrate several mathematical concepts in cryptography. <!-- 2x -->
- [An essay/paper](#paper) <!-- FIX: essay or paper? --> on elliptic curve cryptography and the issues posed to cryptographic standards by technological advancement.


## Program (Edu-ECC)

[Edu-ECC](src/main.py) is a Python script meant to visually demonstrate some of the key trapdoor functions used in modern cryptography and their origins. <!-- 3x... -->
<!-- TODO: DRY -->

### Usage

TODO <!-- instructions -->


## Paper

The paper accompanying this program, [Paper Name :)](./utils/paperName.md), is my own research and interpretation of the current state of modern cryptographic standards including elliptic curve and lattice-based cryptography.  
It is written in MarkDown with TeX support ([VS Code's KaTeX plugin](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-markdown-it-katex)). <!-- REMEMBER to export to PDF or something w pandoc -->
