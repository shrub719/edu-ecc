Edu-ECC's libaries are split into several parts according to their functionality.  

- [EC](ec.md) contains classes related to elliptic curves over finite fields

- [Crypto](crypto.md) extends classes in EC to implement several cryptography schemes, such as ECDH and hybrid assymetric key encryption
