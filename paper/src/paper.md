# Elliptic curve cryptography


## Introduction to elliptic curves

An elliptic curve is an implicit function where one variable has a degree of 2 and the other has a degree of 3. 


## Elliptic curves as an abelian variety

An abelian group is a <!-- TODO -->. An group $G$ that acts as an abelian group under an operation (such as addition, $+$) is written as $(G, +)$.

### Point addition

### Point at infinity

When the points of an elliptic curve are used as an abelian group $(G, +)$, we need an identity point, the *point at infinity*, which is written as $\infty$, $\mathcal{O}$ or $0$. This point is such that, for any point $A$:

1. $A + \infty = A$
1. $\infty + A = A$
1. $A + -A = \infty$ where $-A$ is the inverse of $A$
1. $\infty + \infty = \infty$
